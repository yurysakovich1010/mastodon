      <h3>
        Disallowed content on Brighteon.Social
      </h3>

      <p>
        Content that is subject to being delisted or banned includes (but is not limited to):
      </p>

      <hr class="spacer" />

      <h4>
        1) CONTENT WHICH VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW
      </h4>

      <p>
        Because Brighteon.Social operates inside the United States, it must abide by U.S. laws concerning the legality of content. Brighteon.Social disallows content which promotes or advocates criminal acts such as bomb-making, terrorism, death threats, arson, child porn and so on. This is not a complete list.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where federal law is unconstitutional or stands in violation of basic human rights -- such as federal prohibition of cannabis -- Brighteon.Social sides with Natural Law, which supersedes artificial government laws. In other words, Brighteon.Social welcomes -- but does not specifically recruit or call for -- videos depicting the hydroponic production of cannabis, for example, even in regions where federal law prohibits possession of cannabis. This is because such federal laws stand in violation of basic human rights (access to natural plant medicine).
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, because the right to self-defense is a Natural Law reflected throughout Mother Nature, Brighteon.Social welcomes -- but does not specifically recruit or call for -- videos depicting the possession of firearms for the purpose of self-defense, even if filmed or uploaded from regions where such possession may be deemed illegal by applicable law.
      </p>

      <hr class="spacer" />

      <h4>
        2) CONTENT WHICH VIOLATES LOCAL LAW IN THE LOCAL JURISDICTION
      </h4>

      <p>
        Brighteon.Social geo-restricts content which has been deemed illegal in local jurisdictions. For example, "Holocaust denial" videos -- a term which is not well defined even by those who ban such videos -- are geo-restricted in 15 countries where denial of the Holocaust has been deemed a criminal offense.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other countries have blasphemy laws against mocking religious leaders, and for that reason, such videos are geo-restricted in those countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order for the Brighteon.Social platform to continue to exist in these countries. Brighteon.Social takes active steps to geo-restrict videos that are believed to violate local or national laws.
      </p>

      <hr class="spacer" />

      <h4>
        3) CONTENT WHICH ADVOCATES VIOLENT AGGRESSION - OR GROUPS ESPOUSING VIOLENT AGGRESSION - TOWARD PEOPLE OR ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T DESERVE IT
      </h4>

      <p>
        Brighteon.Social supports freedom of speech with reasonable limits. For example, content which promotes racist KKK activities or organizations with a history of advocating violent aggression (such as Antifa or the DEA) are not allowed, unless posted in the context of news, criticism or public commentary on such activities (subject to review and interpretation by Brighteon.Social).
      </p>

      <p>
        In contrast to the above, depictions of violence in the context of protecting life or liberty is allowed. For example, a video of citizen shooting an attacker in self-defense is allowed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, if a violent Antifa terrorist is caught on video bashing people on their skulls using a bike lock (their favorite weapon), and an armed patriot shoots the Antifa terrorist in the face with a .45 auto in an act of self-defense, that video will certainly be allowed.
      </p>

      <hr class="spacer" />

      <h4>
        4) CONTENT WHICH PROMOTES OR DEPICTS CRUELTY AGAINST LIVING BEINGS
      </h4>

      <p>
        No content is allowed which depicts cruelty against living beings, including unjustified animal cruelty or human torture. These acts are widely considered to be criminal acts, and videos depicting such acts are not allowed on Brighteon.Social. Hunting videos are allowed if they do not depict the suffering of animals. Self-defense shooting videos are allowed if the defensive shooting is justified to halt violence or for purposes of public education to help teach individuals how to defend their life, liberty and property against violent aggressors.
      </p>

      <p>
        This section also covers content which promotes suicide, mass shootings, etc. For example, if a disturbed teenager posts a video claiming he is taking antidepressant drugs and feels like shooting up his local school with a shotgun, such a video would be disallowed. The interpretation of this is up to Brighteon.Social personnel and may be subject to change, depending on a variety of factors, including compliance with local laws.
      </p>

      <hr class="spacer" />

      <h4>
        5) CONTENT DEEMED GENOCIDAL / ANTI-HUMAN / EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO SOCIETY
      </h4>

      <p>
        Content that promotes harmful ideologies that have historically lead to genocide or mass murder is not allowed. For this reason, content promoting Marxism, socialism, Satanism, communism and other harmful belief systems is not allowed on Brighteon.Social. (Such ideologies have resulted in the deaths of over 262 million people worldwide in the last century.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The interpretation of this rule will be in the sole discretion of Brighteon.Social, which strives to protect speech to the fullest. Nevertheless, use of the Brighteon.Social platform to promote anti-human, genocidal or extremely harmful ideologies that have been historically tied to mass human suffering and murder is not allowed.
      </p>

      <h4>
        NOTE: POLICY ON CRYPTOCURRENCY CONTENT:
      </h4>

      <p>
        Brighteon.Social supports "decentralization" innovation, which includes cryptocurrencies. Brighteon.Social’s overall policy is to allow open discussion of cryptocurrencies, ICOs and the decentralization of money, and it is generally our belief that end users bear the burden of taking responsibility for their own actions when it comes to making financial decisions. At the same time, Brighteon.Social reserves the right to ban or de-list videos which are deemed to be promoting a fraudulent scam of any kind, which in the interpretation of Brighteon.Social may subject its public viewers to risk of being defrauded or scammed. For example, videos posted by "Nigerian inheritance scammers" would of course be banned.
      </p>

      <hr class="spacer" />

      <h4>
        6) CONTENT WHICH ATTACKS, SLANDERS OR SMEARS OTHER MEMBERS OF BRIGHTEON.SOCIAL
      </h4>

      <p>
        In the interests of civility, we aim to provide a platform from which independent media personalities may post videos without fear of being unfairly attacked or defamed by others on the same platform. In essence, we aim to provide a platform where each individual has a right to speak without being viciously attacked, shouted down or heckled by other members on the platform who seemingly don't have their own ideas (but have plenty of time to attack everyone else).
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, we fully recognize that government-run operatives will attempt to launch thousands of sock puppet accounts and post videos to smear indy media personalities and sow discord.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to help halt sock puppet "slander videos" targeting indy media, we are launching Brighteon.Social with an unusual rule, which is that no content may attack, by name, other members of Brighteon.Social except in limited circumstances in which the person being attacked is irrefutably involved in disinfo, fraud, criminal behavior or other egregious activities that harm society as a whole (this is all subject to interpretation by Brighteon.Social moderators).
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, videos which sharply criticize big government bureaucrats, the fake news media, corrupt lawmakers and other elements of the "establishment" are welcomed, but not specifically encouraged. This includes education, science, medicine, law, Wall Street and more.
      </p>

      <hr class="spacer" />

      <h4>
        7) CONTENT FROM ANONYMOUS SOURCES*
      </h4>

      <p>
        The point of this rule, which is of course subject to change, is to halt anonymous troll videos which are primarily posted by government-funded operatives attempting to discredit independent media and decentralized technology companies they don't control.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also believe that an individual who is accused of something should be able to face their accuser and identify them. Thus, anonymous accusations are generally disallowed except in very limited circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        * Certain accounts may be granted whistleblower status via a process we are not making public. This is reserved for truly anonymous sources in the vein of Wikileaks or similar organizations whose lives would be jeopardized by their identities being known.
      </p>

      <hr class="spacer" />

      <h4>
        8) CONTENT BELIEVED TO BE POSTED BY DEEP STATE OPERATIVES FOR THE PURPOSE OF SPREADING DISINFORMATION
      </h4>

      <p>
        For obvious reasons, this category of disallowed content is difficult to define. Essentially, Brighteon.Social recognizes that deep state operators running "sock puppet" accounts will attempt to infiltrate and exploit the Brighteon.Social platform to sow chaos, distrust and paranoia across independent media. Any videos which Brighteon.Social believes to be engaged in such tactics may be subject to being de-listed or banned.

      <p>
        For Non-U.S. Law Enforcement: You can't compel Brighteon.Social to provide any user information unless you obtain a valid U.S. court order.
      </p>

      <p>
        What does Brighteon.Social need law enforcement to share user information?
      </p>

      <p>
        To respond to your Law Enforcement Request(s), we will need:
      </p>

      <p>
        The applicable Law Enforcement Request we described above
        <br />
        The username (Brighteon.Social.com/[username]) and/or email address used to create their Brighteon.Social account
        <br />
        A valid return email address from an official government domain
        <br />
        In order to make sure your Law Enforcement Request is narrow and does not seek more information than necessary (potentially at additional cost and time), we ask for the following:
        <br />
        A sufficiently narrow/defined time period of the content in question;
        <br />
        A specific event or action that the subject is alleged to have carried out that would involve content or other information held by Brighteon.Social;
        <br />
        A specific reference number of your request.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you notify users of a Law Enforcement Request?
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, our policy is to notify users of Law Enforcement Requests by providing them with a complete copy of the request before producing their information to law enforcement. We may make exceptions to this policy where:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          we are legally prohibited from providing notice (e.g. by an order under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b));
        </li>
        <li>
          an emergency situation exists involving a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person;
        </li>
        <li>
          we have reason to believe notice wouldn't go to the actual account holder (e.g. an account has been hijacked)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If we receive a National Security Letter (NSL) from the U.S. government that includes an indefinite non-disclosure order, our policy is to ask the government to seek judicial review of the order pursuant to the USA FREEDOM Act.
      </p>

      <p>
        In cases where notice isn't provided because of a court order or emergency situation, our policy is to provide notice to the user once the court order or emergency situation has expired.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: Officer authored affidavits, descriptions, cover letters or similar statements are not sufficient to preclude notice to our users. You must provide a court order issued in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b) or cite an applicable statute if you wish to prohibit user notice of your Law Enforcement Request.

      '<p>The tyranny of Big Tech is now on full display in America as Twitter has unleashed an army of so-called “fact-checkers” (i.e. left-wing propagandists) to place fact-check labels on the tweets of President Trump.</p>

      <p>"Fact-checking" is just the excuse for tech giants like Twitter, Google, Wikipedia, YouTube or Facebook to interrupt the communications of conservative or pro-Trump users with radical left-wing propaganda messages. The very idea that a tech company led by communists and radical left-wing socialists could claim a monopoly on “facts” is absurd. No one has a monopoly on facts, and the entire fact-checking fiasco of the Big Tech ecosystem has boiled down to politically targeted censorship run by radical left-wing propagandists who are truly mentally ill in the fact that they actually believe their delusions are an accurate map of reality.</p>
